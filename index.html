    	<p>“She was one of the very few people I know who possessed a kind of natural talent. As an artiste she had no training </p><p>and yet her sense of timing, her natural understanding of drama, and her gift for humour - all these went to make her </p><p>abundant work talent. Then, of course, her extraordinary good looks made an impact. From the conventional point of </p><p>view you wouldn’t say she was terribly good looking. But, the moment she was in front of the camera, she was tran-</p><p>sformed. She could be just about anybody. But, more than anything her most remarkable quality was her tremendous</p><p> straightforwardness.” </p><p>- Shyam Benegal, renowned Indian director</p><br>

        <p> Smita Patil was one of the most talented artists of the Indian cinema. A fierce feminist, she frequently stated that she would "like to do roles that will project today’s woman with all her complexities, dilemmas, and problems… to show how she’s fighting with herself, with society, and with her family structure, to reach somewhere.” She passed away on December 13th, 1986 but her legacy lives on even today. <br> <br>
